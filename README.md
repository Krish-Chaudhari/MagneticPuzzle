# ðŸ§² CPS506 â€“ Polarity Placement Puzzle Solver

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This repository contains **Elixir** and **Haskell** implementations of the *Polarity Placement Puzzle* â€” a constraint satisfaction problem where bar magnets must be placed on a grid. The puzzle must be solved such that:

- Specific numbers of **positive (`+`)** and **negative (`-`)** poles appear in each row and column,
- Magnet pieces are only placed according to predefined **orientations** (either horizontally `L-R` or vertically `T-B`),
- **No two adjacent identical poles** are placed side-by-side (orthogonally),
- **Some grid spaces may remain empty** and marked with `'X'`.

Each implementation reads board orientation and constraint inputs, processes them, and produces a valid magnet configuration that satisfies all constraints.
